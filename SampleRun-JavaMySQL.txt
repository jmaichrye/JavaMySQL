This program can be used to provide a quickstart to developing between Java and MySQL.  The IDE used for the project
was IntelliJ.  The mysql connector used is mysql-connector-java-5.1.41-bin.jar.  This file is excluded from
the github.  To have a working program you must install the correct plugin in JavaMySQL/libs folder.

This program assumes you have a local MYSQL server running.  The password is set to root yet you can replace
this with your local root's password.  The program selects the country table from the word database.  These are the
sample files provided when you download the most recent mysql.  This program demonstrates connecting to a database and
how you can utilize JDBC libraries to automate database access.
